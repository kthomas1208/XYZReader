Udacity Android Nanodegree Project 5

Author: Kevin Thomas

## Purpose
This app is for Udacity's Android Nanodegree. The goal is to update an app to match Google's Material Design specs. Some concepts covered are:
* Using a `CoordinatorLayout` to handle layout view behaviors like Collapsing Toolbars and Nested Scroll Views. 
* Using elevations on "Materials" to give a sense of depth
* Handling animations to create a seamless experience
* Making text and elements readable and intuitive for a delightful experience

## Description
The app uses dummy data to list articles in a feed reader format. Each article is listed on the main page as a card. The user can click
on each card to see the full article.
